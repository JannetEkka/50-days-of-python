# 50 Days of Python Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the "50 Days of Python" challenge from the book by Benjamin Bennett Alexander. It features 50 Python coding exercises that I completed, one per day, to strengthen my Python programming skills.

## üìö About the Challenge

The "50 Days of Python" challenge presents daily coding problems covering various Python concepts:
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- String manipulation
- File I/O operations
- Working with CSV and JSON files
- SQLite database operations
- Web development with Flask
- And many more Python fundamentals

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by groups of days:
- `day_01_to_10/`: Basic Python operations and simple algorithms
- `day_11_to_20/`: More advanced string operations and data structures
- `day_21_to_30/`: Working with different data types and functions
- `day_31_to_40/`: Implementing various algorithms and techniques
- `day_41_to_49/`: Working with external data and files
- `day_50_flask_app/`: Final project - A web application built with Flask

## üöÄ Final Project: Flask Web Application

The culmination of the challenge is a web application built with Flask (Day 50). This simple website demonstrates:
- Flask routing
- HTML templates with Jinja2
- Template inheritance
- Static file management (CSS, images)
- A responsive user interface
