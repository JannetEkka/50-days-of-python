"""Extra Challenge: Class of Cars 
 
Create three classes of three car brands â€“ Ford, BMW, and Tesla. 
The attributes of the car's objects will be, model, color, year, transmission, and whether the car is electric or not (Boolean value.) 
Consider using inheritance in your answer. 
You will create one object for each car brand: 
 
bmw1 : model: x6, Color: silver, Year: 2018, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False  
tesla1:  model: S, Color: beige, Year: 2017, Transmission: Auto, Electric: True 
ford1 :  model:  focus, Color: white, Year: 2020, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False 
 
You  will  create  a  class  method,  called  print_cars  
that  will  be  able  to print out objects of the class. 
For example, if you call the method on the ford1 object of the Ford class, 
your function should be able to print out car info in this exact format: 
car_model = focus 
Color = White  
Year = 2020  
Transmission = Auto  
Electric = False """

# Creating a base class
class Car:
    def __init__(self, model, color, year, transmission, electric=False):
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.year = year
        self.transmission = transmission
        self.electric = electric

    # Creating class method
    def print_cars(self):
        return (f"car_model = {self.model}\n"
                f"Color = {self.color}\n"
                f"Year = {self.year}\n"
                f"Transmission = {self.transmission}\n"
                f"Electric = {self.electric}")
    
# Creating car model classes using inheritance    
class BMW(Car):
    pass

class Tesla(Car):
    pass

class Ford(Car):
    pass

# Creating class objects
bmw1 = BMW("x6", "silver", "2018", "Auto")  
tesla1 = Tesla("S", "beige", "2017", "Auto", electric=True)
ford1 = Ford("focus", "white", "2020", "Auto")

# calling class method using objects
# print(bmw1.print_cars())
# print(tesla1.print_cars())
print(ford1.print_cars())
